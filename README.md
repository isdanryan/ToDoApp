## **(UX) User Experience**
### **Target Audiences:**
* The target audience is anyone that is looking to organise their work or personal life.
* Anyone that needs or requires the ability to track a list of objectives, wether it's for a school project, personal project or just for life in general.

### **User Stories:**
As a user I want to...
* Continually add to the list.
* Delete things from the list as they are accomplished.
* Easily refer back to the list to see what still needs to be completed.

### **Site Aims:**
* To provide a simple way for users to keep track of task to be completed.
* Save the tasks for each individual user to a database, so the user can keep coming back.
* Allow the user to view the web app from Desktop, Laptop, Tablet or Mobile.
* Be easy to use with clear and simple functionality.
* Only allow viewing of users list once logged in.

### **How This Will Be Achieved:**
* Create a dynamically generated list, where tasks can be created and deleted.
* Create a way for a user to login and store any tasks created against the users login profile.
* Use bootstrap to create a responsive layout that can adjust to any platform.
* The web app will have clear and obvious buttons to carry out the relevant functions.
* It will also feature a clean and modern layout to help avoid any distractions.
* Confirmation messages will be shown to help show the user either a succesful or unsuccessful function.
* The web app will feature a sign up/login requirement to secure each users tasks.
* The main To Do Task page will only be available once the user has logged in.

### **Colour Scheme**
The main background for each page will mainly be white with a dark font to make it easy to read. The navigation bar will be a dark colour with a light font to offset from the mainly white background.
Each of the buttons will be colour coded to help identify their function, e.g. Red = Delete.
The success messages will be coloured green, and the unsuccessful messages will be coloured red to further help identify their intended message at a glance.
